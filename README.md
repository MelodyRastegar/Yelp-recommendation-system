# Yelp-recommendation-system
#Overview
Yelp was founded in 2004 to help people find great local businesses like businesses, hairstylists, etc. Today, the website and their mobile application publish crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses as well as certain metadata about them that can help in customers' decision-making process. Yelp uses automated software to recommend the most helpful and reliable reviews for the Yelp community out of such a large and diverse dataset.

The Yelp dataset is a large collection of user reviews, business metadata, business check-ins, users' social network data, user tips for businesses across 10 cities spread across 4 countries. The original dataset is very huge with ~ 11GB of data. In this case study, we will only use a subset of data due to hardware limitations.
#Objective
we are going to build three types of recommendation systems:
Clustering-based recommendation system
Content-based collaborative filtering
